                        <p>
                        I am seeking to a potential process of theoretical and 
                        artistic practices which I shall coin the prosthetic 
                        method. The characteristics of this method arise from 
                        the mathematical operation of prosthesis (addition).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The prosthetic method, as a creative phenomenon, 
                        originates in the moment of replacing mathematical 
                        symbols-variables with theoretical and artistic 
                        elements. The abstract equation a + b = c is converted 
                        into a prosthetic relationship of rational and 
                        material entities. 
                        For example: 
                        a + b = c &hArr; Logos + b = Matter &hArr; words + b = ink, e.t.c.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Prosthesis, as a mathematical operation, combines two 
                        numbers (addenda) and produces an equal number (a sum), 
                        while the repetition of adding the number one is 
                        the most fundamental type of enumeration:<br/>  
                        [(0+1=1,1+1=2,2+1=3,3+1=4, 4+1=5,5+1=6,……………,99+1=100,100+1=101,………………),N={0,1,2,3,…….}]. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The manner in which the addenda are combined in relation 
                        to the sum gives rise to the main qualities of the 
                        operation. This combination reveals the qualitative 
                        nature of this operation, which can ultimately be 
                        transformed – by transposing thought - from a mere 
                        mathematical operation into a work of art and research.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The commutative property (the order of the addenda may 
                        be changed: a + b = b + a), the associative property 
                        (addenda may be replaced by their sum or broken down: 
                        a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c) and the fact that 0 is a 
                        neutral element (when 0 is added to a natural number 
                        it does not change: a+0=0+a) are the properties of 
                        addition. From observing these properties, it can be 
                        derived that addition is of a qualitative nature. 
                        Thus, it is possible for addition to be interpreted 
                        as a convention of potential balance among elements 
                        of the same nature.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        It is a potential balance because each element can be 
                        converted into two equivalent sums, thus revealing an 
                        internal trend towards the breaking down of the 
                        element.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        For example:<br/>
                        a + b = b + a &hArr;<br/>
                        &hArr;a1+a2 + b = b + a, when a=a2+a1&hArr;<br/>
                        &hArr;a3+a4 + a2 + b = b + a, when a=a2+a4+a3&hArr;<br/>
                        &hArr;a5+a6+ a4 + a2 + b = b + a, when a=a2+a4+a6+a5&hArr;<br/>
                        &hArr;&infin;+……+ a6+ a4 + a2 + b = b + a, when a=a2+a4+a6+………+&infin;&hArr;<br/>
                        &hArr;a=a2+a4+a6+………+a100+………+a1000+………+a&infin; &hArr; lim f(a),a&rarr;&infin;<br/>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Also, each element can be infinitely added to and the 
                        subsequent sums reveal a linear trend towards 
                        maximization.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        For example:<br/>
                        a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c&hArr;<br/>
                        &hArr;a1+a2 + (b + c) = (a + b) + c1+c2&hArr;<br/>
                        &hArr;a3+a4+a2 + (b + c) = (a + b) + c1+c3+c4&hArr;<br/>
                        &hArr;a5+a6+a4+a2 + (b + c) = (a + b) + c1+c3+c5+c6&hArr;<br/>
                        &hArr;&infin;+……+a6+a4+a2 + (b + c) = (a + b) + c1+c3+c5+………+&infin;&hArr;<br/>
                        &hArr;lim f(a)+ (b + c) &rArr; (a + b) +lim f(c), (a,c)&rarr;&infin;<br/>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The same nature of the elements is obvious in both 
                        operations. A natural element can be broken down and 
                        added to, without being changed. A natural element 
                        remains unaffected by zero and independent of the 
                        position of the elements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The prosthetic method is based on this balance. The 
                        prosthetic method to be a method of research and 
                        artistic activity is based also on transforming 
                        logos  matter as addenda of the same nature, into a 
                        relation of syn-ousia.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The main addenda are logos and matter. Logos and matter 
                        are constantly being subjected to addition and 
                        breaking down of elements of the same nature. Logos is 
                        treated as a material phenomenon, without being divested 
                        of its original meaning. Matter is treated as a 
                        narrative without being divested of its spatial 
                        dimension. In this manner, the syn-ousia of elements is 
                        achieved. They become entities of the same nature which 
                        may be subjected to addition and breaking down, without 
                        disturbing the balance of the procedure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Logos is broken down. It becomes a meaning, a cause, an 
                        analogy, a text. It becomes a word, a phrase, a metre, 
                        a formation. It is further broken down. New forms of 
                        alphabetic letters are created. Spaces and punctuation 
                        are eradicated. Each letter becomes autonomous. It is 
                        not a merely element of words and phrases, but become 
                        a visual phenomenon. Text size changes and acquires 
                        various dimensions of reading. Inscriptions which are 
                        not easily discernable, but can always be understood 
                        and cease to be only meaning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Matter is broken down. It becomes space, quality, an 
                        image, a text. It is further broken down. It becomes 
                        flat, a point, a metre, a formation. It is further 
                        broken down. All materials are presented in multiple 
                        stages of processing, so that it is easy to distinguish 
                        the narrative nature of its formation. For example, 
                        plaster is presented in its solid form, in its liquid 
                        form, at high temperatures and back again to its solid 
                        form. A narrative is formed upon the space of the 
                        material. They just cease to be only matter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        At the same time, each element is in a constant 
                        prosthetic relationship with the whole. No texts are 
                        eradicated, no materials are torn away. Each piece of 
                        information is displayed and each point is determined. 
                        Completeness envelopes the void in such a way that zero 
                        is the neutral element of the prosthesis. In this 
                        manner, the continuous prosthesis of elements leads to 
                        a dense depiction of phenomena. To a great extent, 
                        approach their composite nature. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The prosthetic method seems to create the conditions for 
                        a free dense depiction of phenomena. It maintains the 
                        balance of the attempt and activates the theoretical and 
                        artistic practice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        A mathematical representation of syn-ousia can be:<br/>
