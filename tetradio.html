        “This true without lying, certain most true. That which is below is like 
        that which is above that which is above is like that which is below to 
        do the miracles of one only thing. And as all things have been arose 
        from one by the mediation of one: so all things have their birth from 
        this one thing by adaptation. The Sun is its father, the moon its mother, 
        the wind hath carried it in its belly, the earth its nurse. The father 
        of all perfection in the whole world is here. Its force or power is entire 
        if it be converted into earth. Separate thou the earth from the fire, 
        the subtle from the gross sweetly with great industry. It ascends from 
        the earth to the heaven again it descends to the earth and receives the 
        force of things superior and inferior. By this means ye shall have the 
        glory of the whole world thereby all obscurity shall fly from you. 
        Its force is above all force. For it vanquishes every subtle thing and 
        penetrates every solid thing. So was the world created. From this are and 
        do come admirable adaptations whereof the means (Or process) is here in 
        this. Hence I am called Hermes Trismegist, having the three parts of the 
        philosophy of the whole world. That which I have said of the operation of 
        the Sun is accomplished and ended”.

        “…Among these letters is found one of some length addressed to Valerius, 
        probably P. Valerius Asiaticus, consul in A.D. 70. It is a wise letter 
        of philosophic consolation to enable Valerius to bear the loss of his 
        son, and runs as follows: There is no death of anyone, but only in 
        appearance, even as there is no birth of any, save only in seeming. 
        The change from being to be coming seems to be birth, and the change from 
        becoming to being seems to be death, but in reality no one is ever born, 
        nor does one ever die. It is simply a being visible and then invisible; 
        the former through the density of matter, and the latter because of the 
        subtlety of being-being which is ever the same, its only change being 
        motion and rest. For being has this necessary peculiarity, that its 
        change is brought about by nothing external to itself; but whole becomes 
        parts and parts become whole in the oneness of the all…”.

        “…The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, 
        thy whole body shall be full of light. But if thine eye be evil, 
        thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that 
        is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness! God and Mammon 
        No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and 
        love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. 
        Ye cannot serve God and mammon. Therefore I say unto you, Take no 
        thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor 
        yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, 
        and the body than raiment? Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, 
        neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father 
        feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they? Which of you by taking 
        thought can add one cubit unto his stature? And why take ye thought for 
        raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, 
        neither do they spin: and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all 
        his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Wherefore, if God so clothe 
        the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, 
        shall he not much more clotheyou, O ye of little faith? Therefore take 
        no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, 
        Wherewithal shall we be clothed?(For after all these things do the 
        Gentiles seek) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all 
        these things. But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; 
        and all these things shall be added unto you. Take therefore no thought 
        for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. 
        Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof…”

        “…[First came] Thetis (Creation). After that, ancient Poros (Contriver)

        Poros . . . thereupon . . . called him Poros (Contriver) since the 
        beginning provided all things; for when the matter began to be set in 
        order, a certain Poros came into being as a beginning. So Alkman represents 
        the matter of all things as confused and unformed.
        Then he says that one came into being who set all things in order, then that 
        Poros came into being, and that when Poros had passed by Tekmor followed. 
        And Poros is as a beginning, Tekmor like an end. When Thetis (Creation) 
        had come into being, a beginning and end of all things came into being 
        simultaneously, and all things have their nature resembling the matter 
        of bronze, while Thetis has hers resembling that of a craftsman, Poros 
        and Tekmor resembling a beginning and the end.

        “…Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not 
        charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal. And though 
        I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all 
        knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, 
        and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to 
        feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not 
        charity, it profiteth me nothing. Charity suffereth long, and is kind; 
        charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, 
        doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily 
        provoked, thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in 
        the truth; beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, 
        endureth all things. Charity never faileth : but whether there be prophecies, 
        they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there 
        be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know in part, and we prophesy 
        in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in 
        part shall be done away. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I 
        understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I 
        put away childish things. For now we see through a glass, darkly, but 
        then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as 
        also I am known. And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but 
        the greatest of these is charity…”

        “…he says that the universe is infinite, as I have already mentioned; 
        that of it, one part is a plenum, and the other a vacuum. He also says 
        that the elements, and the worlds which are derived from them, are infinite, 
        and are dissolved again into them; and that the worlds are produced in 
        this manner : That many bodies, of various kinds and shapes, are borne 
        by amputation from the infinite, into a vast vacuum; and then, they
        being collected together, produce one vortex; according to which they, dashing
        against one another, and whirling about in every direction, are separated in
        such a way that like attaches itself to like. But as they are all of equal
        weight, when by reason of their number they are no longer able to whirl about,
        the thin ones depart into the outer vacuum, as if they bounded through, and the
        others remain behind, and becoming entangled with one another, run together,
        and produce a sort of spherical shaped figure. This subsists as a kind of membrane;
        containing within itself bodies of every kind; and as these are whirled about
        so as to revolve according to the resistence of the centre, the circumambient
        membrane becomes thin, since bodies are without ceasing, uniting according to
        the impulse given by the vortex; and in this way the earth is produced, since
        these bodies which have once been brought to the centre remain there. On the
        other side, there is produced another enveloping membrane, which increases
        incessantly by the accretion of exterior bodies; and which, as it is itself
        animated by a circular movement, drags with it, and adds to itself, everything
        it meets with; some of these bodies thus enveloped re-unite again and form
        compounds, which are at first moist and clayey, but soon becoming dry, and
        being drawn on in the universal movement of the circular vortex, they catch
        fire, and constitute the substance of the stars…”.  “…now his principal
        doctrines were these. That atoms and the vacuum were the beginning of the
        universe; and that everything else existed only in opinion. That the worlds
        were infinite, created, and perishable. But that nothing was created out of
        nothing, and that nothing was destroyed so as to become nothing. That the atoms
        were infinite both in magnitude and number, and were borne about through the
        universe in endless revolutions. And that thus they produced all the
        combinations that exist; fire, water, air, and earth; for that all these things
        are only combinations of certain atoms; which combinations are incapable of
        being affected by external circumstances, and are unchangeable by reason of
        their solidity. Also, that the sun and the moon are formed by such revolutions
        and round bodies; and in like manner the soul is produced; and that the soul
        and the mind are identical: that we see by the falling of visions across our
        sight; and that everything that happens, happens of necessity. Motion, being
        the cause of the production of everything, which he calls necessity…”
